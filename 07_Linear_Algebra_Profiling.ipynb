    "Julias generic way of implementing algorithms often makes it easy to explore different storage schemes, elevated or reduced precision or to try acceleration hardware like a GPU. I want to present a few illustrating examples on a real-world iterative algorithm to show you how little effort is needed to give these things a try in Julia. I will also show in one example how one can track performance by profiling and understand what should be done to improve an algorithm at hand."
