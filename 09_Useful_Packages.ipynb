    "The number of registered packages in the [General](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/blob/master/Registry.toml) registry is quite vast (about 7100 on **16/02/2022**) and growing every day. So if you have a reasonably standard problem you want to solve, there is a good chance that someone has already made an effort. Even if that's not the case the composability between packages enabled by the Julia language implies that often building blocks from other packages can be easily reused as well. There is also a [great search engine](https://juliahub.com/ui/Packages) for Julia packages.\n",

If you are the developer of a Julia package or usually find yourself coding in one terminal and using the code in another, this package is indispensable.\n",
